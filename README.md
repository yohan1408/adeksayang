# Love Letter 💌

A tiny, cute, interactive **pixel-art love letter** that runs in your browser.

Aim Cupid's bow, release to fire the arrow at the floating envelope, and a retro
"LOVE" window pops open. Answer the question — and the screen fills with falling
hearts. 🎯❤️

## About

A small, heartfelt web toy built with **plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no
frameworks, no build step, no dependencies. The whole thing is ~120&nbsp;KB and
works offline.

## Features

- 🏹 **Interactive bow & arrow** — aim with the mouse/finger, release (or press
  **Space**) to shoot Cupid's arrow.
- 💌 **Animated reveal** — the envelope bursts open into a retro pixel "LOVE"
  window with a little cat.
- 😉 **A playful "NO" button** that dodges your cursor.
- 🎉 **Heart confetti & rain** celebration.
- ♿ **Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`** — shows a calm, static version when
  your system has reduced motion enabled.
- 📱 **Responsive** — works on desktop and touch.

## How to play

1. **Aim** — move your mouse (or finger) to aim the bow.
2. **Shoot** — press & hold, then **release** — or hit the **Space** bar.
3. The envelope opens into the **LOVE** window.
4. Press **YES** (the **NO** button is shy 😉).
5. Enjoy the hearts. Press **✕** to close and shoot again.

## Run it locally

The page loads its JavaScript as a module, so browsers won't run it from a
`file://` path — you need to serve the folder. Pick any one (run it **inside
this folder**):

```bash
# Python (already on most Macs & Linux)
python3 -m http.server 8000
#   → open http://localhost:8000

# …or Node.js
npx serve
#   → open the printed http://localhost:3000

# …or VS Code: install the "Live Server" extension,
#   right-click index.html → "Open with Live Server"
```

Stop a running server with **Ctrl + C**.

## Tech

Plain **HTML5**, **CSS3** (animations, gradients), and **vanilla JavaScript** —
zero libraries, zero build tooling. Fonts (`Press Start 2P`, `Pixelify Sans`)
load from Google Fonts when online and fall back gracefully offline. The cat is
drawn on a `<canvas>`.
